    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 Large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
        <li>8 chicken tenders</li>
        <li>Freshly chopped parsley for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Gather ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat basket with cooking spray. </li>
        <li>Whisk egg in a small bowl. In another bowl, stir together panko and oil until loose and crumbly. </li>
        <li>Dip each chicken tender into egg, allowing excess to drip off. Dip chicken in panko mixture to coat
            completely. Working in batches if needed. </li>
        <li>Arrange chicken in an even layer in the air fryer basket. Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center
            and the juices run clear, about 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read
            at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
        <li> Serve hot garnished with freshly chopped parsley. Enjoy! </li>
    </ol>
