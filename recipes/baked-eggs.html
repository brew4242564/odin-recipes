        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (180 degrees C). Spray a 9x9 baking dish with cooking spray.

            Place block of Boursin in the center of the baking dish.

            Crack 8 eggs carefully into the baking dish around the block of Boursin.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until the egg white around the block of Boursin is cooked through, about 15
